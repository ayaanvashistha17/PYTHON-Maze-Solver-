# PYTHON-Maze-Solver-

Overview

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my Maze Solver project that I built to learn about pathfinding algorithms and game development in Python. It's a interactive game where you can either solve mazes yourself or watch AI algorithms find the solution automatically.

I created this project to strengthen my understanding of algorithms and Python programming. It was challenging but really rewarding to see everything come together!

What It Does
Player Mode: You control a character using arrow keys to navigate through randomly generated mazes
AI Mode: Watch different algorithms (A* and Recursive) solve the maze automatically
Difficulty Settings: Choose between Easy, Medium, or Hard mazes with different sizes and complexity
Visualization: See everything happen in real-time with a clean visual display

Technologies Used
Python 3 - Main programming language
NumPy - For handling the maze grid data
Matplotlib - For visualizing the maze and movements
A Algorithm* - For efficient pathfinding
Recursive Backtracking - Alternative pathfinding method
Challenges I Faced (And How I Solved Them)

1. Implementing the A* Algorithm

This was probably the toughest part! I understood the theory but implementing it in code was tricky. I spent a lot of time reading about how priority queues work and how to calculate the heuristic function properly. After several failed attempts, I finally got it working by breaking the problem into smaller parts and testing each component separately.

2. Real-time Visualization

Getting the display to update smoothly was harder than I expected. At first, the screen would flicker or freeze during movements. I learned about matplotlib's animation functions and how to properly update plots without causing performance issues.

3. Maze Generation

Creating random mazes that were actually solvable was a challenge. My first versions either had too many walls (making impossible mazes) or too few (making it too easy). I eventually found a good balance by experimenting with different wall densities.

4. User Input Handling

Reading arrow key inputs in Python was new to me. I had to learn about event handling in matplotlib and how to map keyboard events to game movements.

What I Learned From This Project

-How to implement complex algorithms from scratch
-The importance of breaking big problems into smaller, manageable parts
-How to create interactive visualizations in Python
-Better understanding of data structures like grids and queues
-Improved debugging and problem-solving skills
-Future Improvements

If I had more time, I'd like to add:

-A timer to track how quickly mazes are solved
-More algorithm options like Dijkstra's algorithm
-A maze editor to create custom levels
-Sound effects and better visuals
-High score tracking
-Final Thoughts

Building this project was a great learning experience! It helped me understand not just how to code, but how to think through problems systematically. There were definitely moments of frustration when things didn't work, but the satisfaction of finally solving each challenge made it all worthwhile.

Feel free to explore the code and try it out yourself! If you have any questions or suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
